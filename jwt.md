## JWT Refactor

### Problem Statement

Previously, our application utilized forever-lived JWTs for client authentication to the backend. This approach posed significant security risks, primarily due to the potential for token compromise, which could allow unauthorized access for an indefinite period.

### Solution Implemented

To enhance security and comply with best practices, I led the initiative to refactor the authentication system. The key components of this refactor included:

**Token Management**: Introduced a dual-token approach, issuing short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens. This method limits the lifespan of any compromised token, significantly reducing potential damage.

**Route Development**: Developed new API routes to enable clients to request new tokens and to invalidate existing tokens for reasons such as expiration or administrative actions.

**Database Integration**: Implemented a new database table dedicated to storing token metadata. This table allows for efficient validation checks, including token expiration and invalidation status.

**Security Enhancements**: Established comprehensive token validation mechanisms to ensure all tokens are checked for expiration and verified against the new database for any invalidation flags.

**Backward Compatibility**: Implemented logic to distinguish between legacy and new tokens, allowing the system to support both during a transitional phase. This approach ensured that existing users experienced no disruption in service while we phased out the legacy tokens.

**Testing and Quality Assurance**: Created a suite of automated tests to verify the functionality of token generation, validation, and management processes, ensuring robust security and functionality.

### Impact

This project significantly bolstered the security of our application by mitigating the risks associated with token compromise. The new system not only enhances user trust but also aligns our authentication practices with industry standards.
