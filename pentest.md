# Project

## Internal Pentest

### Problem Statement

Prior to this project, a comprehensive penetration test of our digital assets had not been conducted for nearly six years. Recognizing the potential risks associated with this lack of testing, I initiated discussions with leadership to define the scope and objectives of a targeted penetration test focused on our API, primarily from the client's perspective.

### Solution Implemented

After securing approval, I developed and executed a detailed penetration testing plan with the following key components:

**Scoping and Planning**: Worked closely with organizational leaders to determine the scope of the test, focusing on our public API and the interactions from client applications.
    
### **Methodology**:
**Infrastructure Scanning**: Conducted scans against public infrastructure hosts to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
        
**Proxy Testing**: Established proxy connections from client applications to the API host to inspect request/response data and application behavior under various conditions.
        
**Input Fuzzing and Abuse Testing**: Applied fuzz testing to input fields and attempted to abuse application features, such as spam attempts and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, to test resilience.
        
**Malformed Request Sending**: Sent malformed and non-standard requests to identify how well the API handled unexpected or malicious input.
    
### **Findings and Issues Identified**:
**Data Leakage**: Detected instances where sensitive data was exposed due to inadequate data handling practices.
        
**Lack of Rate Limiting**: Identified endpoints that were vulnerable to abuse due to missing rate limiting controls.
        
**Validation Bypass**: Found critical validation mechanisms that could be bypassed, posing a significant security risk.

### Impact

The results of the penetration test were eye-opening for our leadership and led to immediate and decisive actions to remediate the identified vulnerabilities:

**Risk Awareness**: Detailed reports and presentations helped leadership understand the potential consequences of the vulnerabilities, facilitating informed decision-making.
    
**Swift Remediation**: Prompted by the findings, we implemented critical updates to our API's security measures, including the introduction of rate limiting, enhanced data validation, and improved handling of sensitive information.
    
**Enhanced Security Posture**: The penetration test significantly strengthened our security posture by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities that had gone unnoticed for years.
